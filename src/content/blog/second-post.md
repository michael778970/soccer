chool is starting again, and with it comes the return of soccer season. Students are excited to get back on the field after the break.

Soccer practice will begin in the first weeks of school. Teams will train to build fitness, skills, and teamwork. Matches will follow, giving players a chance to compete and represent their school.

Playing soccer helps students stay active, make friends, and balance schoolwork with sports. The season also builds school spirit as classmates and families come together to cheer for their teams.

This year, going back to school means going back to soccerâ€”ready for a new season of fun, challenge, and teamwork.
